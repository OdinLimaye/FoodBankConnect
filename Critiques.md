# Self Critiques

- We did well in regards to implementing our REST API to allow easy frontend access to sorted and filtered data from our database in specific ranges and lengths.
- We learned a lot about React, particularly how to make dynamically generated web pages. We also learned a lot about using Python and Flask to build a backend server and API.
- We taught each other how to use AWS and all of its tools, particularly those involving API endpoints and Lambda functions. We also taught each other many details regarding frontend presentation.
- We could improve our web scraping to make use of more sources to fill in sparse data fields that our current sources don't always provide.
- The peer reviews and user stories were helpful most significantly in regards to our UI since we got real feedback on how our site looked and what about it could be improved for easier use.
- We are still puzzled about how to fully automate every aspect of our website's deployment and backend maintenance, such as database filling.

# Project Pencil Critiques

- They did really well in regards to sorting since they had convenient drop-down menus for each of their instances' attributes.
- Their REST API was effective and allowed for both pagination and sorting. It also allowed for a clean subset of the instance data to be displayed on each model page before clicking on a specific card.
- They implemented our user stories well. Some of our user stories were out of scope, but the majority were related to presentation and various sorting/filtering options, all of which are implemented on their site.
- We learned from their website how to make a clean navigational bar and site structure since they had a nice overview of the whole site at the top of each page.
- They haven't implemented filtering yet, at least not on the frontend, so that is something they could improve during the final project phase.
- What still puzzles us is the “projects” instance attribute for schools, since no further explanation of this field is given in the specific instance pages, leaving us a bit confused about what it means.
